    <p>Hi there! I'm Ray. Chances are you saw me performing and decided to visit this site out of curiosity. Welcome.
    </p>

    <h2>buskin' makes me feel good</h2>
    <p>I started busking (street performing) with a friend of mine in Oakland and San Francisco in 2017, when I was in
      high
      school. Now I'm trying it out on my own. It's always been a lot of fun, and I'd like to keep doing it for as long
      as
      possible.</p>
    <h2>my repertoire & music tastes</h2>
    <p>You'll mainly be hearing me play a lot of jazz and J-rock on my keyboard. I'm a big anime fan, which explains the
      J-rock. I know some anime openings and endings. If you ask nicely (or ask rudely but pay me a lot ðŸ’€), I might be
      able
      to play your favorite one! And I got really into jazz when I was in college and went and learned a bunch of jazz
      standards. I think jazz harmony and improvisation are really cool, but really hard, and I'm trying to get better
      at
      wrapping my mind around both of these skills.</p>
    <p>Aside from jazz and J-rock, I like hip-hop, alternative rock, and electronic music too. Some artists/bands I dig
      include Kendrick Lamar, The Killers, Bill Evans, Nujabes, and Asian Kung-Fu Generation.</p>

    <h2>help me afford more anime posters (and music equipment)</h2>

      on.

    <p>Thanks for listening!</p>
