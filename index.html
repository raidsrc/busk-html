    <p>Hi there! I'm Ray. I'm an amateur musician from the San Francisco Bay Area. Welcome to my busking webpage.
    </p>

    <h2>help me afford more anime posters (and music equipment)</h2>
    <p>If you like how I sound, consider leaving me a tip via <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"
        href="https://venmo.com/u/raidsrc">Venmo</a> or <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"

        rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://youtube.com/c/raidsrc">YouTube</a>. That's the platform I'm most active
      on.
    </p>

    <h2>buskin' makes me feel good</h2>
    <p>I started busking (street performing) with a friend of mine in Oakland and San Francisco in 2017, when I was in
      high
      school. Now I'm trying it out on my own. It's always been a lot of fun, and I'd like to keep doing it for as long
      as
      possible.</p>

    <h2>my repertoire & music tastes</h2>
    <p>You'll mainly be hearing me play a lot of jazz and J-rock on my keyboard. I'm a big anime fan, which explains the
      J-rock. I know a couple of anime openings and endings. If you ask nicely (or ask rudely but pay me a lot of money üíÄ), I
      might be able to play your favorite one! And I got really into jazz when I was in college and learned a bunch of
      jazz
      standards. I think jazz harmony and improvisation are really cool, but really hard, and I'm trying to get better
      at wrapping my mind around both of these skills.</p>
    <p>Aside from jazz and J-rock, I like hip-hop, alternative rock, and electronic music too. Some artists/bands I dig
      include Kendrick Lamar, The Killers, Bill Evans, Nujabes, and Asian Kung-Fu Generation.</p>

    <h2>parting words</h2>
    <p>Performing ain't easy! Dragging all my equipment out here early in the morning and putting myself in front of
      hundreds to thousands of people a day... it takes a lot of willpower to do. But I do it because it's fun, and
      because I love seeing the joy on people's faces when I happen to play a song they love.</p>
    <p>Someday, far in the future, I won't be able to perform for people anymore. Even so, I still hope to be able to
      make music for the rest of my life.
      Even if nobody in the world heard me play ever again, I'd still keep playing. Because making music is something I
      love doing. </p>
    <p>But hey. A bit of recognition every once in a while isn't so bad, either. I figure I'd better get some now while
      I'm young and healthy and somewhat motivated.</p>

    <p>Thank you for listening!</p>
